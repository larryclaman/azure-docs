# Azure Backup support matrix

You can use the [Azure Backup service](backup-overview.md) to back up data to the Microsoft Azure cloud. This articles summarizes support settings and limitations for Azure Backup scenarios and deployments.

## Vault support

Azure Backups uses Recovery Services vaults to orchestrate and manage backups, and to store backed up data.

**Setting** | **Details**
--- | ---
Number of vaults | Up to 500 Recovery Services vaults in a single subscription.
Machines in a vault | Up to 1000 Azure VMs in a single vault.<br/><br/> Up to 50 on-premises machines running the Azure Backup agent (Microsoft Azure Recovery Services agent (MABS)) can be registered in a single vault.
Data source in vault storage | Maximum 54400 GB. There's no limit for Azure VM backups.
Backups to vault | Azure VMs: once a day; Machines protected by DPM/MABS: twice a day; Machines backed up directly using MARS agent: three times a day.  
Move vault | To move a Recovery Services vault, you must enroll in a private preview. To try it out, write to AskAzureBackupTeam@microsoft.com.
Move data between vaults | Moving backed up data between vaults isn't supported.
Storage replication type | You can modify the storage replication type (GRS/LRS) for a vault before backups are stored. After backups begin in the vault, the replication type can't be modified.



## On-premises backup support

Here's what's supported if you want to back up on-premises machines.

**Machine** | **Location** | **Back up** | **Features**
--- | --- | --- | ---
**Windows physical/virtual (no backup server)** | Files, folders, system state | Backed up to Recovery services vault | Backup three times a day.<br/><br/> No app-aware backup.<br/><br/> Restore file, folder, volume.
**Linux physical/virtual (no backup server)** | Backup not supported.
**Physical/virtual with DPM** | Files, folders, volumes, system state, app data. | Backed up to DPM (to a disk locally attached to the DPM server, or to tape.<br/><br/> DPM then backs up to vault. | App-aware snapshots<br/><br/> Full granularity for backup and recovery.<br/><br/> Linux supported for VMs (Hyper-V/VMware).<br/><br/>. Oracle not supported.
**Physical virtual with MABS** | Files, folders, volumes, system state, app data. | Backed up to MABS (to a disk locally attached to the MABS server. Tape isn't supported<br/><br/> MABS then backs up to the vault. | App-aware snapshots<br/><br/> Full granularity for backup and recovery.<br/><br/> Linux supported for VMs (Hyper-V/VMware).<br/><br/>. Oracle not supported.


## Azure VMs

### Azure VM limits

**Limit** | **Details**
--- | ---
Azure VM data disks | Limit of 16.
Azure VM data disk size | Individual disk can be up to 4095 GB.


### Azure VM backup options

Here's what's supported if you want to back up Azure VMs.

**Machine** | **Location** | **Back up** | **Features**
--- | --- | --- | ---
**Azure VMs (no backup server)** | Files, folders, system state | Backed up to vault. | Backup once a day.<br/><br/> App-aware backup for Windows VMs, file-consistent backup for Linux VMs. You can configure app-consistency for Linux machines using custom scripts.<br/><br/> Restore VM/disk.<br/><br/> Can't back up on Azure VM to an on-premises location.
**Azure VM with DPM** | Files, folders, volumes, system state, app data. | Backed up to DPM running in Azure (to a disk locally attached to the DPM server. Tape isn't supported.<br/><br/> DPM then backs up to vault. | App-aware snapshots<br/><br/> Full granularity for backup and recovery.<br/><br/> Linux supported for VMs (Hyper-V/VMware).<br/><br/>. Oracle not supported.
**Azure VM with MABS** | Files, folders, volumes, system state, app data. | Backed up to MABS running in Azure (to a disk locally attached to the MABS server). Tape isn't supported<br/><br/> MABS then backs up to the vault. | App-aware snapshots<br/><br/> Full granularity for backup and recovery.<br/><br/> Linux supported for VMs (Hyper-V/VMware).<br/><br/>. Oracle not supported.





## Linux backup support

Here's what's supported if you want to back up Linux machines.

**Backup** | **Linux (Azure endorsed)**
--- | ---
**On-premises Linux machine (without DPM or MABS)**. | No. The MARS agent can only be installed on Windows machines.
**Azure VM (without DPM or MABS)** | App-consistent backup using [custom scripts](backup-azure-linux-app-consistent.md).<br/><br/> File-level recovery.<br/><br/> Restore by creating a VM from a recovery point or disk.
**On-premises machine/Azure VM with DPM** | File-consistent backup of Linux Guest VMs on Hyper-V and VMWare<br/><br/> VM restore of Hyper-V and VMWare Linux Guest VMs</br></br> File-consistent backup not available for Azure VMs
**On-premises machine/Azure VM with MABS** | File-consistent backup of Linux Guest VMs on Hyper-V and VMWare<br/><br/> VM restore of Hyper-V and VMWare Linux guest VMs</br></br> File-consistent backup not available for Azure VMs.

## Disk support

Disk deduplication support is as follows:
- Disk dedup is supported on-premises when you use DPM or MABs to back up Hyper-V VMs running Windows. Windows Server performs data deduplication (at the host level) on virtual hard disks (VHDs) that are attached to the virtual machine as backup storage.
- Deduplication isn't supported in Azure for any Backup component. When System Center DPM and Backup Server are deployed in Azure, the storage disks attached to the VM can't be deduplicated.


## Security/encryption support

Azure Backup supports encryption for in-transit and at-rest data:

Network traffic to Azure:
- Backup traffic from servers to the Recovery Services vault is encrypted using Advanced Encryption Standard 256.
- Backup data is sent over a secure HTTPS link.
- The backup data is stored in the Recovery Services vault in encrypted form.
- Only you have the passphrase to unlock this data. Microsoft can't decrypt the backup data at any point.
    > [!WARNING]
    > After setting up the vault, only you have access to the encryption key. Microsoft never maintains a copy and doesn't have access to the key. If the key is misplaced, Microsoft can't recover the backup data.
Data security:
- When backing up Azure VMs you need to set up encryption *within* the virtual machine.
- Azure Backup supports Azure Disk Encryption, which uses BitLocker on Windows virtual machines and **dm-crypt** on Linux virtual machines.
- On the back end, Azure Backup uses [Azure Storage Service encryption](../storage/common/storage-service-encryption.md), which protects data at rest.


**Machine** | **In transit** | **At rest**
--- | --- | ---
On-premises Windows machines without DPM/MABS | ![Yes][green] | ![Yes][green]
Azure VMs | ![Yes][green] | ![Yes][green]
On-premises/Azure VMs with DPM | ![Yes][green] | ![Yes][green]
On-premises/Azure VMs with MABS | ![Yes][green] | ![Yes][green]



## Compression support

Backup supports the compression of backup traffic, as summarized in the table below. Note that:

- For Azure VMs, the VM extension reads the data directly from the Azure storage account over the storage network, so it is not necessary to compress this traffic.
- If you're using DPM or MABS, you can compress the data before it's backed up to DPM/MABS, to save bandwidth.

**Machine** | **Compress to MABS/DPM (TCP)** | **Compress (HTTPS) to vault**
--- | --- | ---
On-premises Windows machines without DPM/MABS | NA | Yes
Azure VMs | NA | NA
On-premises/Azure VMs with DPM | ![Yes][green] | ![Yes][green]
On-premises/Azure VMs with MABS | ![Yes][green] | ![Yes][green]



## Retention limits

**Setting** | **Limits**
--- | ---
Max recovery points per protected instance (machine/workload | 9999
Max expiry time for a recovery point | No limit
Maximum backup frequency to DPM/MABS | Every 15 minutes for SQL Server<br/><br/> Once a hour for other workloads.
Maximum backup frequency to vault | On-premises Windows machines/Azure VMs running MARS: three per day<br/><br/> DPM/MABS: Two per day<br/><br/> Azure VM backup: Once a day
Recovery point retention | Daily, weekly, monthly, yearly.
Maximum retention period | Depends on backup frequency.
Recovery points on DPM/MABS disk | 64 for file servers, 448 for app servers.<br/><br/> Tape recovery points are unlimited for on-premises DPM.

- [Back up Windows machines directly](tutorial-backup-windows-server-to-azure.md), without a backup server.
- [Set up MABS](backup-azure-microsoft-azure-backup.md) for backup to Azure, and then back up workloads to MABS.
- [Set up DPM](backup-azure-dpm-introduction.md) for backup to Azure, and then back up workloads to DPM.
