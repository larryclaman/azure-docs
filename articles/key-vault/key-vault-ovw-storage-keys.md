# Azure Key Vault managed storage account - CLI

> [!NOTE]
> [Azure storage integration with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is now in preview](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-auth-aad). We recommend using Azure AD for authentication and authorization, which provides OAuth2 token-based access to Azure storage, just like Azure Key Vault. This allows you to:
> - Authenticate your client application using an application or user identity, instead of storage account credentials. 
> - Use an [Azure AD managed identity](/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/) when running on Azure. Managed identities remove the need for client authentication all together, and storing credentials in or with your application.
> - Use Role Based Access Control (RBAC) for managing authorization, which is also supported by Key Vault.

- Azure Key Vault manages keys of an Azure Storage Account (ASA).
    - Internally, Azure Key Vault can list (sync) keys with an Azure Storage Account.    
    - Azure Key Vault regenerates (rotates) the keys periodically.
    - Key values are never returned in response to caller.
    - Azure Key Vault manages keys of both Storage Accounts and Classic Storage Accounts.
    
> [!IMPORTANT]
> An Azure AD tenant provides each registered application with a **[service principal](/azure/active-directory/develop/developer-glossary#service-principal-object)**, which serves as the application's identity. The service principal's Application ID is used when giving it authorization to access other Azure resources, through role-based access control (RBAC). Because Key Vault is a Microsoft application, it's pre-registered in all Azure AD tenants under the same Application ID, within each Azure cloud:
> - Azure AD tenants in Azure government cloud use Application ID `7e7c393b-45d0-48b1-a35e-2905ddf8183c`.
> - Azure AD tenants in Azure public cloud and all others use Application ID `cfa8b339-82a2-471a-a3c9-0fc0be7a4093`.

Prerequisites
--------------
1. [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
   Install Azure CLI   
2. [Create a Storage Account](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/)
    - Follow the steps in this [document](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/) to create a storage account  
    - **Naming guidance:**
      Storage account names must be between 3 and 24 characters in length and may contain numbers and lowercase letters only.        
      
Step by step instructions on how to use Key Vault to manage Storage Account Keys
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the below instructions, we are assigning Key Vault as a service to have operator permissions on your storage account

> [!NOTE]
> Please note that once you've set up Azure Key Vault managed storage account keys they should **NO** longer be changed except via Key Vault. Managed Storage account keys means that Key Vault would manage rotating the storage account key

1. After creating a storage account run the following command to get the resource ID of the storage account, you want to manage

    ```
    az storage account show -n storageaccountname (Copy ID field out of the result of this command)
    ```
    
2. Get Application ID of Azure Key Vault's service principal 

    ```
    az ad sp show --id cfa8b339-82a2-471a-a3c9-0fc0be7a4093
    ```
    
3. Assign Storage Key Operator role to Azure Key Vault Identity

    ```
    az role assignment create --role "Storage Account Key Operator Service Role"  --assignee-object-id <ApplicationIdOfKeyVault> --scope <IdOfStorageAccount>
    ```
    
4. Create a Key Vault Managed Storage Account.     <br /><br />
   Below, we are setting a regeneration period of 90 days. After 90 days, Key Vault will regenerate 'key1' and swap the active key from 'key2' to 'key1'.
   
    ```
    az keyvault storage add --vault-name <YourVaultName> -n <StorageAccountName> --active-key-name key2 --auto-regenerate-key --regeneration-period P90D --resource-id <Resource-id-of-storage-account>
    ```
    In case the user didn't create the storage account and does not have permissions to the storage account, the steps below set the permissions for your account to ensure that you can manage all the storage permissions in the Key Vault.
 > [!NOTE] 
    In the case that the user does not have permissions to the storage account, we first get the Object-Id of the user

    ```
    az ad user show --upn-or-object-id "developer@contoso.com"

    az keyvault set-policy --name <YourVaultName> --object-id <ObjectId> --storage-permissions backup delete list regeneratekey recover     purge restore set setsas update
    ```
    
## How to access your storage account with SAS tokens

In this section we will discuss how you can do operations on your storage account by fetching [SAS tokens](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-dotnet-shared-access-signature-part-1) from Key Vault

In the below section, we demonstrate how to fetch your storage account key that's stored in Key Vault and using that to create a SAS (Shared Access Signature) definition for your storage account.

> [!NOTE] 
  There are 3 ways to authenticate to Key Vault as you can read in the [basic concepts](key-vault-whatis.md#basic-concepts)
- Using Managed Service Identity (Highly recommended)
- Using Service Principal and certificate 
- Using Service Principal and password (NOT recommended)

```cs
// Once you have a security token from one of the above methods, then create KeyVaultClient with vault credentials
var kv = new KeyVaultClient(new KeyVaultClient.AuthenticationCallback(securityToken));

// Get a SAS token for our storage from Key Vault. SecretUri is of the format https://<VaultName>.vault.azure.net/secrets/<ExamplePassword>
var sasToken = await kv.GetSecretAsync("SecretUri");

// Create new storage credentials using the SAS token.
var accountSasCredential = new StorageCredentials(sasToken.Value);

// Use the storage credentials and the Blob storage endpoint to create a new Blob service client.
var accountWithSas = new CloudStorageAccount(accountSasCredential, new Uri ("https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/"), null, null, null);

var blobClientWithSas = accountWithSas.CreateCloudBlobClient();
```

If your SAS token is about to expire, then you would fetch the SAS token again from Key Vault and update the code

```cs
// If your SAS token is about to expire, get the SAS Token again from Key Vault and update it.
sasToken = await kv.GetSecretAsync("SecretUri");
accountSasCredential.UpdateSASToken(sasToken);
```
