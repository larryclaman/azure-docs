# Send events to Azure Event Hubs using Node.js

Azure Event Hubs is a Big Data streaming platform and event ingestion service, capable of receiving and processing millions of events per second. Event Hubs can process and store events, data, or telemetry produced by distributed software and devices. Data sent to an event hub can be transformed and stored using any real-time analytics provider or batching/storage adapters. For detailed overview of Event Hubs, see [Event Hubs overview](event-hubs-about.md) and [Event Hubs features](event-hubs-features.md).

This tutorial describes how to send events to an event hub from an application written in Node.js.

> [!NOTE]
> You can download this quickstart as a sample from the [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-event-hubs-node/tree/master/client), replace `EventHubConnectionString` and `EventHubName` strings with your event hub values, and run it. Alternatively, you can follow the steps in this tutorial to create your own.

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you need the following prerequisites:

- Node.js version 8.x and higher. Download the latest LTS version from [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).
- Visual Studio Code (recommended) or any other IDE

## Create an Event Hubs namespace and an event hub
The first step is to use the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) to create a namespace of type Event Hubs, and obtain the management credentials your application needs to communicate with the event hub. To create a namespace and an event hub, follow the procedure in [this article](event-hubs-create.md), then proceed with the following steps in this tutorial.

Get the connection string for the event hub namespace by following instructions from the article: [Get connection string](event-hubs-get-connection-string.md#get-connection-string-from-the-portal). You use the connection string later in this tutorial.

## Clone the sample Git repository
Clone the sample Git repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-event-hubs-node) on your machine. 

## Install Node.js package
Install Node.js package for Azure Event Hubs on your machine. 

```nodejs
npm install @azure/event-hubs
```

## Clone the Git repository
Download or clone the [sample](https://github.com/Azure/azure-event-hubs-node/tree/master/client/examples) from GitHub. 

## Send events
The SDK you have cloned contains multiple samples that show you how to send events to an event hub using node.js. In this quickstart, you use the **simpleSender.js** example. To observe events being received, open another terminal, and receive events using the [receive sample](event-hubs-node-get-started-receive.md).

1. Open the project on Visual Studio Code. 
2. Create a file named **.env** under the **client** folder. Copy and paste sample environmental variables from the **sample.env** in the root folder.
3. Configure your event hub connection string, event hub name, and storage endpoint. You can copy connection string for your event hub from **Connection string-primary** key under **RootManageSharedAccessKey** on the Event Hub page in the Azure portal. For detailed steps, see [Get connection string](event-hubs-create.md#create-an-event-hubs-namespace).
4. On your Azure CLI, navigate to the **client** folder path. Install node packages and build the project by running the following commands:

    ```nodejs
    npm i
    npm run build
    ```
5. Start sending events by running the following command: 

    ```nodejs
    node dist/examples/simpleSender.js
    ```


## Review the sample code 
Here is the sample code to send events to an event hub using node.js. You can manually create a sampleSender.js file, and run it to send events to an event hub. 


```nodejs
const { EventHubClient, EventPosition } = require('@azure/event-hubs');

const client = EventHubClient.createFromConnectionString(process.env["EVENTHUB_CONNECTION_STRING"], process.env["EVENTHUB_NAME"]);

async function main() {
    // NOTE: For receiving events from Azure Stream Analytics, please send Events to an EventHub where the body is a JSON object/array.
    // const eventData = { body: { "message": "Hello World" } };
    const data = { body: "Hello World 1" };
    const delivery = await client.send(data);
    console.log("message sent successfully.");
}

main().catch((err) => {
    console.log(err);
});

```

Remember to set your environment variables before running the script. You can either configure this in the command line as shown in the following example, or use the [dotenv package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv#dotenv). 

```
// For windows
set EVENTHUB_CONNECTION_STRING="<your-connection-string>"
set EVENTHUB_NAME="<your-event-hub-name>"

// For linux or macos
export EVENTHUB_CONNECTION_STRING="<your-connection-string>"
export EVENTHUB_NAME="<your-event-hub-name>"
```

## Next steps
In this quickstart, you have sent messages to an event hub using Node.js. To learn how to receive events from an event hub using Node.js, see [Receive events from event hub - Node.js](event-hubs-node-get-started-receive.md)
