# How to access a classroom lab in Azure Lab Services
This article describes how to access a classroom lab, connect to the VM in the lab, and stop the VM. 

## Register to a lab
1. Navigate to the **registration URL** that you received from the professor/educator. 
2. Sign in to the service using your school account to complete the registration. 
3. Once registered, confirm that you see the virtual machine for the lab you have access to. 
2. Wait until the virtual machine is ready, and then **start** the VM. This process takes some time.
