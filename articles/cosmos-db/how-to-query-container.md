# Query an Azure Cosmos container

This article explains how to query a container (collection, graph, table) in Azure Cosmos DB.

## In-partition query

When you query data from containers, if the query has a partition key filter specified, Azure Cosmos DB automatically routes the query to the partitions corresponding to the partition key values specified in the filter. For example, the following query is routed to the DeviceId partition which holds all the documents corresponding to partition key value "XMS-0001".

```csharp
// Query using partition key into a class called, DeviceReading
IQueryable<DeviceReading> query = client.CreateDocumentQuery<DeviceReading>(
    UriFactory.CreateDocumentCollectionUri("myDatabaseName", "myCollectionName"))
    .Where(m => m.MetricType == "Temperature" && m.DeviceId == "XMS-0001");
```

## Cross-partition query

The following query does not have a filter on the partition key (DeviceId) and is fanned out to all partitions where it is executed against the partition's index. To execute a query across partitions, set **EnableCrossPartitionQuery** to true (or x-ms-documentdb-query-enablecrosspartition in the REST API).

```csharp
// Query across partition keys into a class called, DeviceReading
IQueryable<DeviceReading> crossPartitionQuery = client.CreateDocumentQuery<DeviceReading>(
    UriFactory.CreateDocumentCollectionUri("myDatabaseName", "myCollectionName"),
    new FeedOptions { EnableCrossPartitionQuery = true })
    .Where(m => m.MetricType == "Temperature" && m.MetricValue > 100);
```

Cosmos DB supports aggregate functions COUNT, MIN, MAX, and AVG over containers by using SQL. The aggregate functions over containers starting from the SDK version 1.12.0 and above. Queries must include a single aggregate operator and must include a single value in the projection.

## Parallel cross-partition query

The Cosmos DB SDKs 1.9.0 and above support parallel query execution options.  Parallel cross-partition queries allow you to perform low latency, cross-partition queries. For example, the following query is configured to run in parallel across partitions.

```csharp
// Cross-partition Order By Query with parallel execution
IQueryable<DeviceReading> crossPartitionQuery = client.CreateDocumentQuery<DeviceReading>(
    UriFactory.CreateDocumentCollectionUri("myDatabaseName", "myCollectionName"),  
    new FeedOptions { EnableCrossPartitionQuery = true, MaxDegreeOfParallelism = 10, MaxBufferedItemCount = 100})
    .Where(m => m.MetricType == "Temperature" && m.MetricValue > 100)
    .OrderBy(m => m.MetricValue);
```

You can manage parallel query execution by tuning the following parameters:

- **MaxDegreeOfParallelism**: Sets the maximum number of simultaneous network connections to the container's partitions. If you set this property to -1, the degree of parallelism is managed by the SDK. If the MaxDegreeOfParallelism is not specified or set to 0, which is the default value, there will be a single network connection to the container's partitions.

- **MaxBufferedItemCount**: Trades query latency versus client-side memory utilization. If this option is omitted or to set to -1, the number of items buffered during parallel query execution is managed by the SDK.

With the same state of the collection, a parallel query will return results in the same order as a serial execution. When performing a cross-partition query that includes sorting operators (ORDER BY and/or TOP), the Azure Cosmos DB SDK issues the query in parallel across partitions and merges partially sorted results in the client side to produce globally ordered results.
