# Create a synthetic partition key

It's a best practice to have a partition key with many distinct values such as hundreds or thousands. The goal is to distribute your data and workload evenly across the items associated with these partition key values. If such a property doesn’t exist in your data, a synthetic partition key can be constructed. The following sections describe several basic techniques for generating a synthetic partition key for your container.

## Concatenating multiple properties of an item

You can form a partition key by concatenating multiple property values into a single artificial `partitionKey` property. These keys are referred to as synthetic keys. For example, consider the following example document:

```JavaScript
{
"deviceId": "abc-123",
"date": 2018
}
```

For the previous document, one option is to set /deviceId or /date as the partition key, if you want to partition your container based on either device ID or date. Another option is to concatenate these two values into a synthetic `partitionKey` property that is used as the partition key.

```JavaScript
{
"deviceId": "abc-123",
"date": 2018,
"partitionKey": "abc-123-2018"
}
```

In real-time scenarios, you can have thousands of documents in a database, so instead of adding the synthetic key manually, you should define client-side logic to concatenate values and insert the synthetic key into the documents.

## Using a partition key with random suffix

Another possible strategy to distribute the workload more evenly is to append a random number at the end of the partition key value. Distributing items in this way enables you perform parallel write operations across partitions.

For example, if a partition key represents a date, you might choose a random number between 1 and 400 and concatenate it as a suffix to the date. This method results in partition key values like 2018-08-09.1, 2018-08-09.2, and so on, through 2018-08-09.400. Because you are randomizing the partition key, the write operations on the container on each day are spread evenly across multiple partitions. This method results in better parallelism and overall higher throughput.

## Using a partition key with pre-calculated suffixes 

Though randomizing strategy can greatly improve write throughput, it's difficult to read a specific item because you don't know the suffix value that is used when writing the item. To make it easier to read individual items, you can use the pre-calculated suffixes strategy. Instead of using a random number to distribute the items among partitions, use a number that calculate based on something that you want to query.

Consider the previous example, where a container uses a date in the partition key. Now suppose that each item has an accessible VIN (Vehicle-Identification-Number) attribute and if you often run queries to find items by VIN, in addition to date. Before your application writes the item to the container, it can calculate a hash suffix based on the VIN and append it to the partition key date. The calculation might generate a number between 1 and 400 that is evenly distributed, similar to the results produced by the random strategy method. The partition key value will then be the date concatenated with the calculated result.

With this strategy, the writes are evenly spread across the partition key values, and across the partitions. You can easily read a particular item and date, because you can calculate the partition key value for a specific Vehicle-Identification-Number. The benefit of this method is that you can avoid creating a single hot partition key (the partition key that takes all the workload).
