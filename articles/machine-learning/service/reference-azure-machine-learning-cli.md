# Use the CLI extension for Azure Machine Learning service

The Azure Machine Learning CLI is an extension to the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/?view=azure-cli-latest), a cross-platform command-line interface for the Azure platform. This extension provides commands for working with the Azure Machine Learning service from the command line. It allows you to create scripts that automate your machine learning workflows. For example, you can create scripts that perform the following actions:

+ Run experiments to create machine learning models

+ Register machine learning models for customer usage

+ Package, deploy, and track the lifecycle of your machine learning models

The CLI is not a replacement for the Azure Machine Learning SDK. It is a complementary tool that is optimized to handle highly parameterized tasks such as:

* Creating compute resources

* Parameterized experiment submission

* Model registration

* Image creation

* Service deployment

## Prerequisites


* To use the CLI, you must have an Azure subscription. If you donâ€™t have an Azure subscription, create a free account before you begin. Try the [free or paid version of Azure Machine Learning service](http://aka.ms/AMLFree) today.

* The [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/?view=azure-cli-latest).

## Install the extension

To install the Machine Learning CLI extension, use the following command:

```azurecli-interactive
az extension add -s https://azuremlsdktestpypi.blob.core.windows.net/wheels/sdk-release/Preview/E7501C02541B433786111FE8E140CAA1/azure_cli_ml-1.0.6-py2.py3-none-any.whl --pip-extra-index-urls  https://azuremlsdktestpypi.azureedge.net/sdk-release/Preview/E7501C02541B433786111FE8E140CAA1
```

When prompted, select `y` to install the extension.

To verify that the extension has been installed, use the following command to display a list of ML-specific subcommands:

```azurecli-interactive
az ml -h
```

> [!TIP]
> To update the extension you must __remove__ it, and then __install__ it. This installs the latest version.

## Remove the extension

To remove the CLI extension, use the following command:

```azurecli-interactive
az extension remove -n azure-cli-ml
```

## Resource management

The following commands demonstrate how to use the CLI to manage resources used by Azure Machine Learning.


+ Create an Azure Machine Learning service workspace:

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az ml workspace create -n myworkspace -g myresourcegroup
    ```

+ Set a default workspace:

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az configure --defaults aml_workspace=myworkspace group=myresourcegroup
    ```
    
* Attach an AKS cluster

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az ml computetarget attach aks -n myaks -i myaksresourceid -g myrg -w myworkspace
    ```

## Experiments

The following commands demonstrate how to use the CLI to work with experiments:

* Attach a project (run configuration) before submitting an experiment:

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az ml project attach --experiment-name myhistory
    ```

* Start a run of your experiment. When using this command, specify the name of the `.runconfig` file that contains the run configuration. The compute target uses the run configuration to create the training environment for the model. In this example, the run configuration is loaded from the `./aml_config/myrunconfig.runconfig` file.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az ml run submit -c myrunconfig train.py
    ```

    Default `.runconfig` files named `docker.runconfig` and `local.runconfig` are created when you attach a project using the `az ml project attach` command. You may need to modify these before using them to train a model. 

    You can also create a run configuration programmatically using the [RunConfiguration](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.runconfig.runconfiguration?view=azure-ml-py) class. Once created, you can then use the `save()` method to create the `.runconfig` file.

* View a list of submitted experiments:

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az ml history list
    ```

## Model registration, image creation & deployment

The following commands demonstrate how to register a trained model, and then deploy it as a production service:

+ Register a model with Azure Machine Learning:

  ```azurecli-interactive
  az ml model register -n mymodel -m sklearn_regression_model.pkl
  ```

+ Create an image that contains your machine learning model and dependencies: 

  ```azurecli-interactive
  az ml image create container -n myimage -r python -m mymodel:1 -f score.py -c myenv.yml
  ```

+ Deploy an image to a compute target:

  ```azurecli-interactive
  az ml service create aci -n myaciservice --image-id myimage:1
  ```
