# Use SSL to secure web services with Azure Machine Learning service

In this article, you will learn how to secure a web service deployed with the Azure Machine Learning service. You can restrict access to web services and secure the data submitted by clients using secure socket layers (SSL) and key-based authentication.

> [!Warning]
> If you do not enable SSL, any user on the internet will be able to make calls to the web service.

SSL encrypts data sent between the client and the web service. It also used by the client to verify the identity of the server. Authentication is only enabled for services that have provided an SSL certificate and key.  If you enable SSL, an authentication key is required when accessing the web service.

Whether you deploy a web service enabled with SSL or you enable SSL for existing deployed web service, the steps are the same:

1. Get a domain name.

2. Get an SSL certificate.

3. Deploy or update the web service with the SSL setting enabled.

4. Update your DNS to point to the web service.

There are slight differences when securing web services across the [deployment targets](how-to-deploy-and-where.md).

## Get a domain name

If you do not already own a domain name, you can purchase one from a __domain name registrar__. The process differs between registrars, as does the cost. The registrar also provides you with tools for managing the domain name. These tools are used to map a fully qualified domain name (such as www.contoso.com) to the IP address hosting your web service.

## Get an SSL certificate

There are many ways to get an SSL certificate. The most common is to purchase one from a __Certificate Authority__ (CA). Regardless of where you obtain the certificate, you need the following files:

* A __certificate__. The certificate must contain the full certificate chain, and must be PEM-encoded.
* A __key__. The key must be PEM-encoded.

When requesting a certificate, you must provide the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the address you plan to use for the web service. For example, www.contoso.com. The address stamped into the certificate and the address used by the clients are compared when validating the identity of the web service. If the addresses do not match, the clients will receive an error.

> [!TIP]
> If the Certificate Authority cannot provide the certificate and key as PEM-encoded files, you can use a utility such as [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) to change the format.

> [!WARNING]
> Self-signed certificates should be used only for development. They should not be used in production. Self-signed certificates can cause problems in your client applications. For more information, see the documentation for the network libraries used in your client application.

## Enable SSL and deploy

To deploy (or re-deploy) the service with SSL enabled, set the `ssl_enabled` parameter to `True`, wherever applicable. Set the `ssl_certificate` parameter to the value of the __certificate__ file and the `ssl_key` to the value of the __key__ file.

+ **Deploy on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**

  While provisioning the AKS cluster, provide values for SSL-related parameters as shown in the code snippet:

    ```python
    from azureml.core.compute import AksCompute

    provisioning_config = AksCompute.provisioning_configuration(ssl_cert_pem_file="cert.pem", ssl_key_pem_file="key.pem", ssl_cname="www.contoso.com")
    ```

+ **Deploy on Azure Container Instances (ACI)**

  While deploying to ACI, provide values for SSL-related parameters as shown in the code snippet:

    ```python
    from azureml.core.webservice import AciWebservice

    aci_config = AciWebservice.deploy_configuration(ssl_enabled=True, ssl_cert_pem_file="cert.pem", ssl_key_pem_file="key.pem", ssl_cname="www.contoso.com")
    ```

## Update your DNS

Next, you must update your DNS to point to the web service.

+ **For ACI**:

  Use the tools provided by your domain name registrar to update the DNS record for your domain name. The record must point to the IP address of the service.

  Depending on the registrar, and the time to live (TTL) configured for the domain name, it can take several minutes to several hours before clients can resolve the domain name.

+ **For AKS**:

  Update the DNS under the "Configuration" tab of the "Public IP Address" of the AKS cluster as shown in the image. You can find the Public IP Address as one of the resource types created under the resource group that contains the AKS agent nodes and other networking resources.

+ **For FPGA**:

Using SSL with services deployed to FPGA is not currently supported.
