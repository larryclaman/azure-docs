# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Drift

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Drift with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

Integrating Drift with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

- You can control in Azure AD who has access to Drift.
- You can enable your users to automatically get signed-on to Drift (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
- You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [what is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](../manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md)

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Drift, you need the following items:

- An Azure AD subscription
- A Drift single sign-on enabled subscription

> [!NOTE]
> To test the steps in this tutorial, we do not recommend using a production environment.

To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

- Do not use production environment, unless it is necessary.
- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can [get a one-month trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment. 
The scenario outlined in this tutorial consists of two main building blocks:

1. Adding Drift from the gallery
2. Configuring and testing Azure AD single sign-on

## Adding Drift from the gallery

To configure the integration of Drift into Azure AD, you need to add Drift from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add Drift from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon. 

	![The Azure Active Directory button][1]

2. Navigate to **Enterprise applications**. Then go to **All applications**.

	![The Enterprise applications blade][2]

3. To add new application, click **New application** button on the top of dialog.

	![The New application button][3]

4. In the search box, type **Drift**, select **Drift** from result panel then click **Add** button to add the application.

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Drift based on a test user called "Britta Simon".

For single sign-on to work, Azure AD needs to know what the counterpart user in Drift is to a user in Azure AD. In other words, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Drift needs to be established.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Drift, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configuring Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configuring-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Creating an Azure AD test user](#creating-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
3. **[Creating a Drift test user](#creating-a-drift-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Drift that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
4. **[Assigning the Azure AD test user](#assigning-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Testing single sign-on](#testing-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configuring Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal and configure single sign-on in your Drift application.

**To configure Azure AD single sign-on with Drift, perform the following steps:**

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Drift** application integration page, click **Single sign-on**.

	![Configure single sign-on link][4]

2. On the **Select a Single sign-on method** dialog, Click **Select** for **SAML** mode to enable single sign-on.

    ![Configure Single Sign-On](common/tutorial_general_301.png)

3. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, click **Edit** icon to open **Basic SAML Configuration** dialog.

	![Configure Single Sign-On](common/editconfigure.png)

4. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps, if you wish to configure the application in **IDP** initiated mode:

	![Drift Domain and URLs single sign-on information](./media/drift-tutorial/tutorial_drift_url.png)

    a. Click **Set additional URLs**.

	b. In the **Relay State** text box, type a URL: `https://app.drift.com`

	c. If you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode, in the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL: `https://start.drift.com`

5. Drift application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format. Configure the following claims for this application. You can manage the values of these attributes from the **User Attributes & Claims** section on application integration page. Click **Edit** button to open **User Attributes & Claims** dialog.

	![image](./media/drift-tutorial/tutorial_drift_attribute.png)

6. In the **User Claims** section on the **User Attributes & Claims** dialog, configure SAML token attribute as shown in the image above and perform the following steps:
    
	| Attribute Name | Attribute Value |
	| ---------------| --------------- |    
	| Name | user.displayname |

	a. Click on the `name` claim (highlighted claim) to open the **Manage user claims** dialog.

	![image](./media/drift-tutorial/tutorial_drift_attribute3.png)

	b. Select Source as **Attribute**.

	c. Make the **Namespace** blank.

	d. From the **Source attribute** list, select **user.displayname**.

	e. Click **Save**.

7. On the **SAML Signing Certificate** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Download** to download **Federation Metadata XML** and then save metadata file on your computer.
