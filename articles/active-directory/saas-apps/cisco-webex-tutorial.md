# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Cisco Webex

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Cisco Webex with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
Integrating Cisco Webex with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

* You can control in Azure AD who has access to Cisco Webex.
* You can enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Cisco Webex (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
* You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).
If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Cisco Webex, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/)
* Cisco Webex single sign-on enabled subscription

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* Cisco Webex supports **SP** initiated SSO

* Cisco Webex supports **Just In Time** user provisioning

* Cisco Webex supports **Automated** user provisioning

## Adding Cisco Webex from the gallery

To configure the integration of Cisco Webex into Azure AD, you need to add Cisco Webex from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add Cisco Webex from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon.

	![The Azure Active Directory button](common/select-azuread.png)

2. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select the **All Applications** option.

	![The Enterprise applications blade](common/enterprise-applications.png)

3. To add new application, click **New application** button on the top of dialog.

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Cisco Webex based on a test user called **Britta Simon**.
For single sign-on to work, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Cisco Webex needs to be established.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Cisco Webex, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Configure Cisco Webex Single Sign-On](#configure-cisco-webex-single-sign-on)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
3. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Create Cisco Webex test user](#create-cisco-webex-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Cisco Webex that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
6. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal.

To configure Azure AD single sign-on with Cisco Webex, perform the following steps:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **Cisco Webex** application integration page, select **Single sign-on**.

    ![Configure single sign-on link](common/select-sso.png)

2. On the **Select a Single sign-on method** dialog, select **SAML/WS-Fed** mode to enable single sign-on.

	c. After successful completion of uploading Service Provider metadata file the **Identifier** and **Reply URL** values get auto populated in **Basic SAML Configuration** section:

	![Cisco Webex Domain and URLs single sign-on information](common/sp-identifier-reply.png)

	In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<SUBDOMAIN>.webex.com/`

	> [!Note]
	> The Sign on URL value is not real. Update this value with the actual Sign on URL. Contact [Cisco Webex Client support team](https://www.webex.co.in/support/support-overview.html) to get this value.

10. Cisco Webex application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format. Configure the following claims for this application. You can manage the values of these attributes from the **User Attributes** section on application integration page. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, click **Edit** button to open **User Attributes** dialog.

	![image](common/edit-attribute.png)

11. In the **User Claims** section on the **User Attributes** dialog, configure SAML token attribute as shown in the image above and perform the following steps:

### Create Cisco Webex test user

The objective of this section is to create a user called Britta Simon in Cisco Webex. Cisco Webex supports just-in-time provisioning and automatic user provisioning, which is by default enabled. There is no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Cisco Webex, a new one is created when you attempt to access Cisco Webex.

### Test single sign-on

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration using the Access Panel.

When you click the Cisco Webex tile in the Access Panel, you should be automatically signed in to the Cisco Webex for which you set up SSO. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-saas-access-panel-introduction).
