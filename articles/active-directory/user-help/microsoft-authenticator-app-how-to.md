# Download and install the Microsoft Authenticator app
The Microsoft Authenticator app helps you sign-in to your accounts if you use two-factor verification. Two-factor verification helps you to access your accounts more securely, especially while viewing sensitive information. Because passwords can be forgotten, stolen, or compromised, two-factor verification is an additional security step that helps protect your account by making it harder for other people to break in.

You can use the Microsoft Authenticator app in multiple ways, including:

- **Two-factor verification.** The standard verification method, where one of the factors is your password. After you sign-in using your username and password, you can either approve a notification or enter a provided verification code.

- **Phone sign-in.** A version of two-factor verification that lets you sign-in without requiring a password, using your username and your mobile device with your fingerprint, face, or PIN.

>[!NOTE]
>If you're having issues signing in to your account, see [When you can't sign in to your Microsoft account](https://support.microsoft.com/help/12429) for help.  Get more info about what to do when you receive the [“That Microsoft account doesn't exist”](https://support.microsoft.com/help/13811) message when you try to sign in to your Microsoft account.

## Download and install the app
Install the latest version of the Microsoft Authenticator app, based on your operating system:

- **Google Android.** On your Android device, go to Google Play to [download and install the Microsoft Authenticator app](https://app.adjust.com/e3rxkc_7lfdtm?fallback=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.azure.authenticator).

- **Apple iOS.** On your Apple iOS device, go to the App Store to [download and install the Microsoft Authenticator app](https://app.adjust.com/e3rxkc_7lfdtm?fallback=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fmicrosoft-authenticator%2Fid983156458).

- **Windows Phone.** On your Windows Phone, go to the Microsoft Store to [download and install the Microsoft Authenticator app](https://app.adjust.com/e3rxkc_7lfdtm?fallback=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fmicrosoft-authenticator%2F9nblgggzmcj6).

    >[!Note]
    >You can't use the phone sign-in process on Windows phones. You must use the standard verification process, as described in the [Set up two-step verification](multi-factor-authentication-end-user-first-time.md) article.
