# Configure Threat Detection (Preview) in Azure SQL Database Managed Instance

Azure SQL [Threat Detection](sql-database-threat-detection-overview.md) for [SQL Database Managed Instance](sql-database-managed-instance-index.yml) detects anomalous activities indicating unusual and potentially harmful attempts to access or exploit databases. Threat Detection can identify **Potential SQL injection**, **Access from unusual location or data center**, **Access from unfamiliar principal or potentially harmful application**, and **Brute force SQL credentials** - see more details in [Threat Detection alerts](sql-database-threat-detection-overview.md#azure-sql-database-threat-detection-alerts).

You can receive notifications about the detected threats via [email notifications](sql-database-threat-detection-overview.md#explore-anomalous-database-activities-upon-detection-of-a-suspicious-event) or [Azure portal](sql-database-threat-detection-overview.md#explore-threat-detection-alerts-for-your-database-in-the-azure-portal)

[Threat Detection](sql-database-threat-detection-overview.md) is part of the [SQL Advanced Data Security](sql-advanced-threat-protection.md) (ADS) offering, which is a unified package for advanced SQL security capabilities. Threat Detection can be accessed and managed via the central SQL ADS portal. Threat detection service is charged 15$/month per Managed Instance, with first 30 days free of charge.

## Set up Threat Detection for your Managed Instance in the Azure portal

1. Launch the Azure portal at [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Navigate to the configuration page of the Managed Instance you want to protect. In the **Settings** page, select **Threat Detection**.
3. In the Threat Detection configuration page
   - Turn **ON** Threat detection.
   - Configure the **list of emails** to receive security alerts upon detection of anomalous database activities.
   - Select the **Azure storage account** where anomalous threat audit records are saved.
4. Click **Save** to save the new or updated threat detection policy.
