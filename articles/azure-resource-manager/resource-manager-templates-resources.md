# Resources section of Azure Resource Manager templates

In the resources section, you define the resources that are deployed or updated. This section can get complicated because you must understand the types you're deploying to provide the right values.

[!INCLUDE [updated-for-az](../../includes/updated-for-az.md)]

## Available properties

You define resources with the following structure:

```json
"resources": [
  {
      "condition": "<true-to-deploy-this-resource>",
      "apiVersion": "<api-version-of-resource>",
      "type": "<resource-provider-namespace/resource-type-name>",
      "name": "<name-of-the-resource>",
      "location": "<location-of-resource>",
      "tags": {
          "<tag-name1>": "<tag-value1>",
          "<tag-name2>": "<tag-value2>"
      },
      "comments": "<your-reference-notes>",
      "copy": {
          "name": "<name-of-copy-loop>",
          "count": <number-of-iterations>,
          "mode": "<serial-or-parallel>",
          "batchSize": <number-to-deploy-serially>
      },
      "dependsOn": [
          "<array-of-related-resource-names>"
      ],
      "properties": {
          "<settings-for-the-resource>",
          "copy": [
              {
                  "name": ,
                  "count": ,
                  "input": {}
              }
          ]
      },
      "sku": {
          "name": "<sku-name>",
          "tier": "<sku-tier>",
          "size": "<sku-size>",
          "family": "<sku-family>",
          "capacity": <sku-capacity>
      },
      "kind": "<type-of-resource>",
      "plan": {
          "name": "<plan-name>",
          "promotionCode": "<plan-promotion-code>",
          "publisher": "<plan-publisher>",
          "product": "<plan-product>",
          "version": "<plan-version>"
      },
      "resources": [
          "<array-of-child-resources>"
      ]
  }
]
```

| Element name | Required | Description |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| condition | No | Boolean value that indicates whether the resource will be provisioned during this deployment. When `true`, the resource is created during deployment. When `false`, the resource is skipped for this deployment. |
| apiVersion |Yes |Version of the REST API to use for creating the resource. |
| type |Yes |Type of the resource. This value is a combination of the namespace of the resource provider and the resource type (such as **Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts**). |
| name |Yes |Name of the resource. The name must follow URI component restrictions defined in RFC3986. In addition, Azure services that expose the resource name to outside parties validate the name to make sure it isn't an attempt to spoof another identity. |
| location |Varies |Supported geo-locations of the provided resource. You can select any of the available locations, but typically it makes sense to pick one that is close to your users. Usually, it also makes sense to place resources that interact with each other in the same region. Most resource types require a location, but some types (such as a role assignment) don't require a location. |
| tags |No |Tags that are associated with the resource. Apply tags to logically organize resources across your subscription. |
| comments |No |Your notes for documenting the resources in your template |
| copy |No |If more than one instance is needed, the number of resources to create. The default mode is parallel. Specify serial mode when you don't want all or the resources to deploy at the same time. For more information, see [Create several instances of resources in Azure Resource Manager](resource-group-create-multiple.md). |
| dependsOn |No |Resources that must be deployed before this resource is deployed. Resource Manager evaluates the dependencies between resources and deploys them in the correct order. When resources aren't dependent on each other, they're deployed in parallel. The value can be a comma-separated list of a resource names or resource unique identifiers. Only list resources that are deployed in this template. Resources that aren't defined in this template must already exist. Avoid adding unnecessary dependencies as they can slow your deployment and create circular dependencies. For guidance on setting dependencies, see [Defining dependencies in Azure Resource Manager templates](resource-group-define-dependencies.md). |
| properties |No |Resource-specific configuration settings. The values for the properties are the same as the values you provide in the request body for the REST API operation (PUT method) to create the resource. You can also specify a copy array to create several instances of a property. |
| sku | No | Some resources allow values that define the SKU to deploy. For example, you can specify the type of redundancy for a storage account. |
| kind | No | Some resources allow a value that defines the type of resource you deploy. For example, you can specify the type of Cosmos DB to create. |
| plan | No | Some resources allow values that define the plan to deploy. For example, you can specify the marketplace image for a virtual machine. | 
| resources |No |Child resources that depend on the resource being defined. Only provide resource types that are permitted by the schema of the parent resource. The fully qualified type of the child resource includes the parent resource type, such as **Microsoft.Web/sites/extensions**. Dependency on the parent resource isn't implied. You must explicitly define that dependency. |

## Condition

When you must decide during deployment whether or not to create a resource, use the `condition` element. The value for this element resolves to true or false. When the value is true, the resource is created. When the value is false, the resource isn't created. The value can only be applied to the whole resource.

Typically, you use this value when you want to create a new resource or use an existing one. For example, to specify whether a new storage account is deployed or an existing storage account is used, use:

```json
{
    "condition": "[equals(parameters('newOrExisting'),'new')]",
    "type": "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts",
    "name": "[variables('storageAccountName')]",
    "apiVersion": "2017-06-01",
    "location": "[resourceGroup().location]",
    "sku": {
        "name": "[variables('storageAccountType')]"
    },
    "kind": "Storage",
    "properties": {}
}
```

For a complete example template that uses the `condition` element, see [VM with a new or existing Virtual Network, Storage, and Public IP](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/201-vm-new-or-existing-conditions).

## Resource-specific values

The **apiVersion**, **type**, and **properties** elements are different for each resource type. The **sku**, **kind**, and **plan** elements are available for some resource types, but not all. To determine values for these properties, see [template reference](/azure/templates/).

## Resource names

Generally, you work with three types of resource names in Resource Manager:

* Resource names that must be unique.
* Resource names that aren't required to be unique, but you choose to provide a name that can help you identify the resource.
* Resource names that can be generic.

### Unique resource names

Provide a unique resource name for any resource type that has a data access endpoint. Some common resource types that require a unique name include:

* Azure Storage<sup>1</sup> 
* Web Apps feature of Azure App Service
* SQL Server
* Azure Key Vault
* Azure Cache for Redis
* Azure Batch
* Azure Traffic Manager
* Azure Search
* Azure HDInsight

<sup>1</sup> Storage account names also must be lowercase, 24 characters or less, and not have any hyphens.

When setting the name, you can either manually create a unique name or use the [uniqueString()](resource-group-template-functions-string.md#uniquestring) function to generate a name. You also might want to add a prefix or suffix to the **uniqueString** result. Modifying the unique name can help you more easily identify the resource type from the name. For example, you can generate a unique name for a storage account by using the following variable:

```json
"variables": {
    "storageAccountName": "[concat(uniqueString(resourceGroup().id),'storage')]"
}
```

### Resource names for identification
Some resource types you might want to name, but their names don't have to be unique. For these resource types, you can provide a name that identifies both the resource context and the resource type.

```json
"parameters": {
    "vmName": { 
        "type": "string",
        "defaultValue": "demoLinuxVM",
        "metadata": {
            "description": "The name of the VM to create."
        }
    }
}
```

### Generic resource names
For resource types that you mostly access through a different resource, you can use a generic name that is hard-coded in the template. For example, you can set a standard, generic name for firewall rules on a SQL server:

```json
{
    "type": "firewallrules",
    "name": "AllowAllWindowsAzureIps",
    ...
}
```

## Location
When deploying a template, you must provide a location for each resource. Different resource types are supported in different locations. To see a list of locations that are available to your subscription for a particular resource type, use Azure PowerShell or Azure CLI. 

The following example uses PowerShell to get the locations for the `Microsoft.Web\sites` resource type:

```powershell
((Get-AzResourceProvider -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.Web).ResourceTypes | Where-Object ResourceTypeName -eq sites).Locations
```

The following example uses Azure CLI to get the locations for the `Microsoft.Web\sites` resource type:

```azurecli
az provider show -n Microsoft.Web --query "resourceTypes[?resourceType=='sites'].locations"
```

After determining the supported locations for your resources, set that location in your template. The easiest way to set this value is to create a resource group in a location that supports the resource types, and set each location to `[resourceGroup().location]`. You can redeploy the template to resource groups in different locations, and not change any values in the template or parameters. 

The following example shows a storage account that is deployed to the same location as the resource group:

```json
{
	"$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2015-01-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
	"contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
	"variables": {
      "storageName": "[concat('storage', uniqueString(resourceGroup().id))]"
    },
	"resources": [
    {
      "apiVersion": "2016-01-01",
      "type": "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts",
      "name": "[variables('storageName')]",
      "location": "[resourceGroup().location]",
      "tags": {
        "Dept": "Finance",
        "Environment": "Production"
      },
      "sku": {
        "name": "Standard_LRS"
      },
      "kind": "Storage",
      "properties": { }
    }
	]
}
```

If you need to hardcode the location in your template, provide the name of one of the supported regions. The following example shows a storage account that is always deployed to North Central US:

```json
{
	"$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2015-01-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
	"contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
	"resources": [
    {
      "apiVersion": "2016-01-01",
      "type": "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts",
      "name": "[concat('storageloc', uniqueString(resourceGroup().id))]",
      "location": "North Central US",
      "tags": {
        "Dept": "Finance",
        "Environment": "Production"
      },
      "sku": {
        "name": "Standard_LRS"
      },
      "kind": "Storage",
      "properties": { }
    }
	]
}
```

## Child resources

Within some resource types, you can also define an array of child resources. Child resources are resources that only exist within the context of another resource. For example, a SQL database can't exist without a SQL server so the database is a child of the server. You can define the database within the definition for the server.

```json
{
  "name": "exampleserver",
  "type": "Microsoft.Sql/servers",
  "apiVersion": "2014-04-01",
  ...
  "resources": [
    {
      "name": "exampledatabase",
      "type": "databases",
      "apiVersion": "2014-04-01",
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```

When nested, the type is set to `databases` but its full resource type is `Microsoft.Sql/servers/databases`. You don't provide `Microsoft.Sql/servers/` because it's assumed from the parent resource type. The child resource name is set to `exampledatabase` but the full name includes the parent name. You don't provide `exampleserver` because it's assumed from the parent resource.

The format of the child resource type is: `{resource-provider-namespace}/{parent-resource-type}/{child-resource-type}`

The format of the child resource name is: `{parent-resource-name}/{child-resource-name}`

But, you don't have to define the database within the server. You can define the child resource at the top level. You might use this approach if the parent resource isn't deployed in the same template, or if want to use `copy` to create more than one child resource. With this approach, you must provide the full resource type, and include the parent resource name in the child resource name.

```json
{
  "name": "exampleserver",
  "type": "Microsoft.Sql/servers",
  "apiVersion": "2014-04-01",
  "resources": [ 
  ],
  ...
},
{
  "name": "exampleserver/exampledatabase",
  "type": "Microsoft.Sql/servers/databases",
  "apiVersion": "2014-04-01",
  ...
}
```

When constructing a fully qualified reference to a resource, the order to combine segments from the type and name isn't simply a concatenation of the two. Instead, after the namespace, use a sequence of *type/name* pairs from least specific to most specific:

```json
{resource-provider-namespace}/{parent-resource-type}/{parent-resource-name}[/{child-resource-type}/{child-resource-name}]*
```

For example:

`Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/myVM/extensions/myExt` is correct
`Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/extensions/myVM/myExt` is not correct
