# Azure security policies monitored by Azure Security Center
This article provides you with a list of Azure Policy definitions that can be monitored in Security Center. For more information about security policies, see [Working with security policies](tutorial-security-policy.md).

## Available security policies

To understand the built-in policies that are monitored by Security Center, refer to the following table:

| Policy | What the policy does |
| --- | --- |
|Audit enabling of diagnostics logs in Service Fabric and Virtual Machine Scale Sets|It is recommended to enable Logs so that activity trail can be recreated when investigations are required in the event of an incident or a compromise.|
|Audit authorization rules on Event Hub namespaces|Event Hub clients should not use a namespace level access policy that provides access to all queues and topics in a namespace. To align with the least privilege security model, you should create access policies at the entity level for queues and topics to provide access to only the specific entity.|
|Audit existence of authorization rules on Event Hub entities|Audit existence of authorization rules on Event Hub entities to grant least-privileged access.|
|Audit unrestricted network access to storage accounts|Audit unrestricted network access in your storage account firewall settings. Instead, configure network rules so only applications from allowed networks can access the storage account. To allow connections from specific Internet or on-premise clients, access can be granted to traffic from specific Azure virtual networks or to public Internet IP address ranges.|
|Audit usage of custom RBAC rules|Audit built-in roles such as 'Owner, Contributor, Reader' instead of custom RBAC roles, which are error prone. Using custom roles is treated as an exception and requires a rigorous review and threat modeling.|
|Audit enabling of diagnostic logs in Azure Stream Analytics|Audit enabling of logs and retain them up to a year. This enables you to recreate activity trails for investigation purposes when a security incident occurs or your network is compromised.|
|Audit secure transfer to storage accounts|Audit requirement of Secure transfer in your storage account. Secure transfer is an option that forces your storage account to accept requests only from secure connections (HTTPS). Use of HTTPS ensures authentication between the server and the service and protects data in transit from network layer attacks such as man-in-the-middle, eavesdropping, and session-hijacking.|
|Audit provisioning of an Azure Active Directory administrator for SQL server|Audit provisioning of an Azure Active Directory administrator for your SQL server to enable Azure AD authentication. Azure AD authentication enables simplified permission management and centralized identity management of database users and other Microsoft services.|
|Audit authorization rules on Service Bus namespaces|Service Bus clients should not use a namespace level access policy that provides access to all queues and topics in a namespace. To align with the least privilege security model, you should create access policies at the entity level for queues and topics to provide access to only the specific entity.|
|Audit enabling of diagnostic logs in Service Bus|Audit enabling of logs and retain them up to a year. This enables you to recreate activity trails for investigation purposes when a security incident occurs or your network is compromised.|
|Audit the setting of ClusterProtectionLevel property to EncryptAndSign in Service Fabric|Service Fabric provides three levels of protection (None, Sign and EncryptAndSign) for node-to-node communication using a primary cluster certificate. Set the protection level to ensure that all node-to-node messages are encrypted and digitally signed.| 
|Audit usage of Azure Active Directory for client authentication in Service Fabric|Audit usage of client authentication only via Azure Active Directory in Service Fabric| 
|Audit enabling of diagnostic logs for Search service|Audit enabling of logs and retain them up to a year. This enables you to recreate activity trails for investigation purposes when a security incident occurs or your network is compromised.| 
|Audit enabling of only secure connections to your Azure Cache for Redis|Audit enabling of only connections via SSL to Azure Cache for Redis. Use of secure connections ensures authentication between the server and the service and protects data in transit from network layer attacks such as man-in-the-middle, eavesdropping, and session-hijacking| 
|Audit enabling of diagnostic logs in Logic Apps|Audit enabling of logs and retain them up to a year. This enables you to recreate activity trails for investigation purposes when a security incident occurs or your network is compromised.| 
|Audit enabling of diagnostic logs in Key Vault|Audit enabling of logs and retain them up to a year. This enables you to recreate activity trails for investigation purposes when a security incident occurs or your network is compromised.|
|Audit enabling of diagnostic logs in Event Hub|Audit enabling of logs and retain them up to a year. This enables recreation of activity trails for investigation purposes when a security incident occurs or your network is compromised.| 
|Audit enabling of diagnostic logs in Azure Data Lake Store|Audit enabling of logs and retain them up to a year. This enables you to recreate activity trails for investigation purposes when a security incident occurs or your network is compromised.| 
|Audit enabling of diagnostic logs in Data Lake Analytics|Audit enabling of logs and retain them up to a year. This enables you to recreate activity trails for investigation purposes when a security incident occurs or your network is compromised.| 
|Audit use of classic storage accounts|Use Azure Resource Manager for your storage accounts to provide security enhancements such as: stronger access control (RBAC), better auditing, Azure Resource Manager based deployment and governance, access to managed identities, access to key vault for secrets, Azure AD-based authentication and support for tags and resource groups for easier security management.| 
|Audit use of classic virtual machines|Use Azure Resource Manager for your virtual machines to provide security enhancements such as: stronger access control (RBAC), better auditing, Azure Resource Manager based deployment and governance, access to managed identities, access to key vault for secrets, Azure AD-based authentication and support for tags and resource groups for easier security management.| 
|Audit configuration of metric alert rules on Batch accounts|Audit configuration of metric alert rules on Batch account to enable the required metric.| 
|Audit configuration of metric alert rules on Batch accounts|Audit configuration of metric alert rules on Batch account to enable the required metric.| 
|Audit enabling of diagnostic logs in Batch accounts|Audit enabling of logs and retain them up to a year. This enables you to recreate activity trails for investigation purposes when a security incident occurs or your network is compromised.| 
|Audit enablement of encryption of Automation account variables|It is important to enable encryption of Automation account variable assets when storing sensitive data.| 
|Audit enabling of diagnostic logs in App Services|Audit enabling of diagnostic logs on the app. This enables you to recreate activity trails for investigation purposes if a security incident occurs or your network is compromised.| 
|Audit transparent data encryption status|Audit transparent data encryption status for SQL databases.| 
|Audit SQL server level Auditing settings|Audits the existence of SQL Auditing at the server level.| 
|[Preview]: Monitor unencrypted SQL database in Azure Security Center|Unencrypted SQL servers or databases will be monitored by Azure Security Center as recommendations.|
