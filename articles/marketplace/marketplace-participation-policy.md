## Offering classification

|     |    |
| :------------------- | :-------------------|
| **Virtual Machine Image** | Pre-configured virtual machine (VM) image with a fully installed operating system, and one or more applications. Virtual Machine Image offerings may include a single VM image or multiple VM images tied together by a Resource Manager template. <br> <br> A virtual machine image (“Image”) provides the information necessary to create and deploy virtual machines in the Azure Virtual Machines service. An Image comprises an operating system, virtual hard drive, and zero or more data disk virtual hard drives. Customers can deploy any number of virtual machines from a single Image. |
| **Virtual Machine Extension** | VM agents that can be added to new VMs using various options, including via REST API, the Azure portal, or Azure PowerShell cmdlets. VM Extensions can also be manually installed on existing VMs, and can be configured for either Windows Server or Linux-based VMs. <br> <br> A virtual machine extension (“**VM Extension**”) is mechanism for installing a software application, or suite of software applications, within Azure virtual machines. A VM Extension may include software applications.  Once it is installed within or executed by a virtual machine, it may download and install one or more software applications from an external location. For clarity, any software or other data installed by your VM Extension, even if retrieved from an external location, is considered Offering Contents for purposes of this Agreement. You are responsible, and must provide support to Customers, for any VM Extension handlers associated with your VM Extension Offerings. |
| **Services** | Fully managed services for information workers, business analysts, developers, or IT pros to use in custom application development or system management. The Marketplace supports three types of services: <br> <br> **Application Services** provide functionality to enable customers to quickly develop cloud scale applications on Azure. <br> <br> Customers must have an Azure subscription to purchase Application Services. Publishers are responsible for metering customers’ usage of Application Services and for reporting usage information to Microsoft, as detailed in the Microsoft Marketplace Publisher Agreement.|
| **Web Application** | Application package that can be used to install and deploy open source or proprietary website content or management platforms in the Azure Websites Service. Web Applications must comply with the Microsoft [Web Application Gallery Principles](https://www.iis.net/learn/develop/windows-web-application-gallery/windows-web-application-gallery-principles). <br> <br> In this Agreement, a “**Web Application**” is an application package used by Customers to install and deploy open source or proprietary website applications in the Azure Website Service. |
| **Catalog Listing** | Offerings that are not available to Azure customers directly through the Marketplace, but the Marketplace displays a link, icon, and software/service product listing.  Customers are directed to the publisher’s web site, or provided instructions on how to obtain and use the offering on Azure. A “**Catalog-Only Listing**” is an Offering that is not available to Customers directly through the Marketplace. Instead, a link, icon, and/or description is displayed in the Marketplace, that directs customers to your website. Furthermore, instructions are provided on how customers may obtain and use the Offering in Azure. For clarity, any software or data referenced by a Catalog-Only Listing is considered Offering Contents in this Agreement. |
| **Azure Resource Manager (Resource Manager) Template** | Resource Manager template can reference multiple, distinct offerings, including offerings published by other publishers.  It enables Azure customers to deploy one or more offerings in a single, coordinated fashion. <br> <br> An “**Azure Resource Manager (Azure Resource Manager) Template**” is a data structure that references one or more Offerings and includes metadata about the Offering(s).  The data structure is associated with Listing Information. Resource Manager templates are used by the Marketplace Service to display and enable customers to deploy certain categories of Offerings. Publishers may publish ARM Templates in the Marketplace that reference multiple, distinct Offerings, including offerings published by other publishers. |
| | |

If you wish to publish an application or service not in any of the categories already discussed, enter a request on the [Azure Marketplace Forum](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/216369-azure-marketplace).

## Pricing models

The following table describes the pricing models currently supported by the Azure Marketplace. An offering may include different SKUs that utilize different pricing models.

| **Pricing Model** | **Description** | **Applicable to** |
| :---------------- | :---------------| :-----------------|
| **Free** | Free SKU. Customers are not charged Azure Marketplace fees for use of the offering. Prices for free SKUs may not be increased to non-zero amounts. | <ul><li>Virtual Machine Images</li><li>VM Extensions</li><li>Services</li><li>Resource Manager templates</li></ul> |
| **Free Trial** <br> **(Try it now)** | Promotional free SKU for a limited period of time. Customers are not charged Azure Marketplace fees for use of the offering through a trial period. Upon expiration of the trial period, customers are automatically charged based on standard rates for use of the offering. The Marketplace is currently not able to prevent customers from creating multiple subscriptions to Free Trial offerings. Publishers who wish to restrict the number of subscriptions customers may create for Free Trial offerings, are responsible for including appropriate restrictions in their Terms of Use. | <ul><li>Virtual Machine Images</li><li>Services</li></ul> |
**BYOL** | Bring-Your-Own-License (BYOL) SKU. If they have obtained access or use of the offering outside of the Azure Marketplace, customers are not charged Azure Marketplace fees. | Virtual Machine Images |
| **Monthly Subscription** | Customers are charged a fixed monthly fee for a subscription to the offering. Monthly subscriptions begin on the date of customer purchase except as described below. Monthly fees are not prorated for mid-month customer cancellations, or unused services. Monthly fees may be prorated if the customer's licensing terms require calendar monthly billing, or if the customer upgrades or downgrades its subscription in the middle of the month. Upgrades and downgrades are only supported if the Publisher configures the offering accordingly. | Services |
| **Usage-Based** | Customers are charged based on the extent of their use of the offering. For Virtual Machine Images, customers are charged an hourly Azure Marketplace fee, as set by publishers, for use of virtual machines deployed from the images. The hourly fee may be uniform or varied across virtual machine sizes. Partial hours are charged by the minute. <br><br> For Application Services, publishers are responsible for defining the unit of measurement for billing purposes. (for example, number of transactions, number of emails sent, etc.) Publishers can define multiple meters for the same Application Service plan. Publishers are responsible for tracking individual customers’ usage, with each meter defined by the offering. They also need to report this tracking information to Microsoft on an hourly basis, using reporting mechanisms provided by Microsoft. Microsoft charges customers based on the usage information reported by publishers for the applicable billing period. | <ul><li>Services</li><li>Virtual Machine Images</li></ul> |
| | | |

Publishers can now lower their user fees for virtual machine offerings already published. All other types of price alterations for existing offerings are currently not supported in the Marketplace. Publishers who wish to change the user fees associated with an offering, should first remove the offering from the Marketplace.  Removal should be done in accordance to the requirements of the Microsoft Marketplace Publisher Agreement and this document.  Then the publisher can publish a new offering that includes the new user fees.

After publishing a Services Offering in the Marketplace, Publishers must maintain their own data logs for a minimum of two (2) previous calendar years. The data logs contain the provisioning of their Offering to customers. If there are any conflicts in the data between the Publisher’s data logs and Microsoft’s data logs, Microsoft’s data logs take precedence.

## Offering suspension and removal

1. Microsoft reserves the right to suspend or remove an offering from the Azure Marketplace for any reason. Reasons Microsoft may remove an offering include, but are not limited to:
    * The offering hasn't been provisioned by any customers for six or more months;
    * The offering has a high cancellation rate for paid SKUs;
    * The offering consistently receives negative customer feedback;
    * The offering consistently receives many support tickets; or
    * The publisher has failed to comply with terms and conditions in the Microsoft Marketplace Publisher Agreement, the Marketplace Publication Guidelines, or this document.

1. For various reasons, you may decide to remove your offer from the Marketplace. Offer Removal ensures that new customers may no longer purchase or deploy your offer, but has no impact on existing customers. Offer Termination is the process of terminating the service and/or licensing agreement between you and your existing customers. Guidance and policies related to offer removal and termination are governed by Microsoft Marketplace Publisher Agreement (see Section 7). You may request removal or termination by logging a support ticket.

## Payment terms

Publishers are paid applicable Publisher Net Revenues, as defined in the Microsoft Marketplace Publisher Agreement, within 45 days after each calendar month.

## Microsoft software products

Microsoft permits publishers to include the following Microsoft Software Products in their Image Offerings, subject to the terms and conditions of Exhibit B of the Microsoft Marketplace Publisher Agreement:

* Windows Server®
* SQL Server®
* Microsoft Dynamics NAV®

## Taxes

1. **Microsoft Remittance Countries.**

    1. The following countries are Microsoft Remittance Countries, as defined in the Microsoft Marketplace Publisher Agreement: European Union, Canada, India, Ireland, Liechtenstein, Monaco, New Zealand, Norway, Puerto Rico, South Korea, Switzerland, United States. Australia, Saudi Arabia, Taiwan, and United Arab Emirates are Microsoft Remittance countries only for Web Direct sales.

    1. Within Ireland, Microsoft charges Irish VAT to all Irish customers (unless Irish customer provides details of a valid VAT 56B certificate). For business customers within the European Union and Norway (located outside of Ireland), Microsoft applies the zero rate of VAT when provided with a valid VAT number. If a valid VAT number is not provided, then customers are charged VAT at the rate applicable in the customer’s country/jurisdiction.

    1. Microsoft charges Swiss VAT to all customers in Switzerland or Liechtenstein.

1. **ISV Remittance Countries.**

    1. ISV Remittance Countries include all sell-to countries as defined in Section 1 (3) of this Policy that is not Microsoft Remittance Countries. In addition, sales for Australia, Saudi Arabia, Taiwan, and United Arab Emirates via the Enterprise channel, are treated as ISV Remittance sales. However, with regards to publishers in Taiwan, Microsoft cannot confirm that any such Taiwanese publishers are collecting and remitting applicable taxes.

    1. If publishers choose to make offerings available in an ISV Remittance Country, such publishers have sole responsibility to determine their tax obligation in such ISV Remittance Country, if any.  They must acknowledge that Microsoft may not currently be able to provide the transaction details required for publishers to provide customers with tax invoices.

## Security events

Publishers must report suspected security events, including security incidents and vulnerabilities of their Azure Marketplace software and service offerings, at the earliest opportunity. Publishers should log a support ticket using the process outlined [Azure security event support ticket](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/azure-security-event-support-ticket), by providing the requested information.
