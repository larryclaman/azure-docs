> This article has recently been updated to use commands from the new Azure PowerShell Az
> module. This module is the new PowerShell module for Azure, compatible with
> PowerShell versions 5.x and 6. AzureRM will continue to get critical bugfix updates, but 
> new features will be in the Az module only.
>
> * To learn more about the Az module and continued support for the AzureRM module,
>   see [Introducing the new Azure PowerShell Az module](/powershell/azure/new-azureps-module-az).
> * The Az module is already available on Cloud Shell, with AzureRM compatibility automatically enabled.
>   For instructions on installing the Az module, see [Install Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/install-az-ps).
> * To enable the AzureRM compatibility commands, run `Enable-AzureRmAlias` after installation.
>   For more on compatibility, see [Migrate from Azure PowerShell AzureRM to Az](/powershell/azure/migrate-from-azurerm-to-az).
